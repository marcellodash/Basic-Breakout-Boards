Neopixel WS2812B Breakout v1.0
===========================================

This is a breadboard-compatible breakout board for a WS2812B or 5050-compatible RGB "Neopixel" LED.

It must be driven with 5V from a microcontroller, but it has the 470-ohm resistor on the input DI line to protect against voltage spikes. 

The project is released as open hardware under the CERN v1.2 Open Hardware license.

You can order a set of three bare boards for $1.20 from OSH Park <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Zs3Bet2O">here</a>.
