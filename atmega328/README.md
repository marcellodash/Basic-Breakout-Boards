# Basic Atmega328 Breakout Board v1.1

This is a breakout board for the Atmega328. It supports input voltage up to 16V, regulating down to 5V for the microcontroller. A bootloader can be loaded over ICSP and then the board can be powered and communicated with over an FTDI cable. All the input/output pins are broken out for prototyping.
