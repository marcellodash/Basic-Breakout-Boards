# Basic-Breakout-Boards

This is a collection of KiCad projects containing breakout boards that will be or have been designed, laid out, assembled, and tested. 

They are based on wickerlib, so to use them you can grab the <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/wickerlib">wickerlib</a> symbols and footprints, and you'll be all set.

All the work here is released under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2.
